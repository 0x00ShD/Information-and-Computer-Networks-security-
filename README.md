### Information-and-Computer-Networks-security :
This course provides a comprehensive overview of information and computer networks security, focusing on the principles, practices, and technologies used to protect data and systems from cyber threats. Students will explore various aspects of security, including cryptography, network protocols, authentication, access control, and intrusion detection.

The course covers both theoretical concepts and practical approaches to securing computer networks, with hands-on experience in implementing security measures. Topics include encryption algorithms, public key infrastructure (PKI), secure communication protocols (like SSL/TLS), firewalls, VPNs, and emerging security challenges in cloud computing and IoT.

Students will also examine case studies of real-world security breaches to understand the impact of cyber-attacks and the importance of robust security policies. By the end of the course, participants will have a solid foundation in network security, equipping them with the skills to design, implement, and manage security strategies in a professional environment.

Key Learning Outcomes:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of information security and cryptography.
- Learn to identify, analyze, and mitigate various types of cyber threats and attacks.
- Gain hands-on experience with security tools and technologies used in network defense.
- Develop the ability to design and implement secure network architectures.
- Stay informed about current trends and future challenges in the field of network security.
